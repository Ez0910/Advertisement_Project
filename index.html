                            We started as cheese lovers,now we are cheese makers. This product started because there was a school assignment that required us to make a biotechnology-themed food product. In the end, we chose to make a cheese as a product that is easy to be made and consumed. Our passion for artisan cheese began in a small home kitchen, experimenting with flavors.
                        </p></b>

                        <p>
                            Today, we’ve grown into a dedicated team, but our hands are still in the process. We still stir the curd ourselves, test every batch, and dream up new flavor combinations inspired by seasons, travel, and tradition.

                            We believe great cheese begins with a healthy environment and strong local partnerships. That’s why we work closely with nearby dairy farms that prioritize animal welfare and sustainable practices. From eco-friendly packaging to reducing food waste, every choice we make is a step toward preserving the land we love the same land that nurtures the fresh milk used in our cheeses. We also give back by supporting local food drives and teaching workshops about traditional cheese makings.
